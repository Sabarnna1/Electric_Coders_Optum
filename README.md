# Electric_Coders_Optum
## Implementation 
### We are using the flask API to convert the files into JSON values which is hosted in this link https://optum-analysis.herokuapp.com/ with endpoints :-               
<ul>
  <li><b>medicine</b>: type of medicines and count</li><li><b>procedures</b>: type of procedures and count</li><li><b>allergies</b>: type of allergies and count</li><li><b>most_prefered_insurance </b>: number of insurance companies and count</li><li><b>insurance_transaction</b>: patient using and not using insurance</li><li><b>patient_issue_count </b>: patient count for each cases</li></ul>
  
## Steps to Contribute
### Use '*npm install*' to install the requirements to convert the JSON data values to array values to use for Analysis. We need to extract the csv zip folder to get the csv files 
## Web Page Description 
### Our main page is index.html from which we can do analysis and prediction. In the analysis page there are many charts and plots and in the prediction page there is a form which user needs to fill to predict if they are adhering or non-adhering.
